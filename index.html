    <h1 class="head"><b>Sustainability in Everyday Life</b><br><i><sup style="font-size: 3vw">for high-schoolers</sup><br></i></h1>
    <h2><b><i>Sustainability can seem overwhelming,<br>and is often an afterthought, however,<br>there are many ways you can make a difference.</i></b></h2>

    <p class="main">Everyone is familiar with the recycling triangle: “reduce, reuse, recycle”, right? Too often, people forget that the first step to a more sustainable lifestyle is to reduce consumption.</p>
    <p class="main">First off, ditch <a href = "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/03/books/review/how-fast-fashion-is-destroying-the-planet.html">fast fashion</a> <link> and <a href = "https://wrapcompliance.org/blog/micro-trends-the-acceleration-of-fashion-cycles-and-rise-in-waste/">"micro-trends"</a> <link>. While, when you’re buying clothes, it may be hard to identify if a particular piece of clothes is a micro-trend, ask yourself if you can see yourself wearing it one year, 6 months, even three weeks from today. If you can’t see yourself wearing it, reconsider buying.</p>

    <p class="main">Sustainable fashion doesn’t need to be expensive either. Thrift shopping is one easy way to save money and the environment at the same time. Also, if you prefer to online shop, <a href = "https://www.thredup.com/">ThredUp</a><link> and <a href = "https://www.therealreal.com/">The Real Real</a><link> are just two of many online thrift stores.</p>

    </a>
    
    <p class="main">However, if you decide not to go down the second-hand route, plenty of sustainable clothing brands do exist; <a href = "https://www2.hm.com/en_us/sustainability-at-hm/our-work/transparent.html">H&M</a><link> was rated the highest scoring brand by The Fashion Transparency Index in 2020. <a href = "https://www.aritzia.com/us/en/aritzia/corporate-responsibility/sustainability.html">Aritzia</a><link>, while on the more expensive side, is also committed to making and impact and include a very clear sustainability report on their website. Changes they have made include reducing carbon emissions, sourcing more sustainable raw materials as well as reducing packaging.</p>
    
    <p class="main">Even throughout all this improvement The Fashion Transparency Index of 2021 still reports that “progress on transparency in the global fashion industry is still too slow among 250 of the world’s largest retailers”. It seems as though fashion brands are disclosing less about their actual environmental impact, and more about their policies and commitments. While there are improvements in the fashion industry, they aren’t coming fast enough. If you want to read the full report you can download it <a href = "https://www.fashionrevolution.org/about/transparency/">here</a><link>.</p>

    <p class="main">Next, get a reusable water bottle and take it with you everywhere. While at first this can seem like a hassle, over time it becomes a habit. I never leave the house without my water, so I never have to buy a single use water bottle. Here are some links to a few of my favorites:

    <p class="main"><a href = "https://plasticoceans.org/the-facts/">Plastic Oceans</a><link> reports that 10 million tons of plastic are dumped in oceans each year, with many of these plastic products being used for just minutes before getting thrown away. While one water bottle may not seem like a big difference, plastic water bottles were created out of manufactured demand. Bottled water companies used tactics to scare consumers out of drinking tap water while seducing consumers to their more “pristine” and “exclusive” bottled water. The truth is most tap water in the United States is perfectly safe to drink; in fact, 1/3 of all bottled water comes straight from the tap, with brands such as Aquafina and Dasani using filtered tap water in their products. If enough people stop buying plastic water bottles, the demand for them drops, and along with it, the plastic in our oceans.</p>

    <p class="main">If you want to know about the story behind bottled water, <a href = "https://www.storyofstuff.org/">The Story of Stuff Project</a><link> has an informative video about bottled water which you can watch <a href = "https://www.storyofstuff.org/movies/story-of-bottled-water/">here</a><link>.</p>

    <p class="main">Look out for <a href = "https://www.fairtradecertified.org/products">fair trade</a><link> products when shopping. Fair trade is a global moment towards sustainable food products. Fair Trade selas ensure the workers have safe working conditions and fair wages, as well as environmental protection and Community Development funds. Fair trade products are sold in most grocery stores; if given the opportunity, buy fair trade.</p>

    <p class="main">Next up is composting. Whether is be pouring old coffee grinds onto plants, or creating your own compost pile in the backyard, anything is better than throwing away organic material and having it take up space in already overcrowded landfills. According to <a href = "https://www.epa.gov/recycle/composting-home">this site</a><link>, organic waste takes up more than thirty percent of trash and landfills. All this organic matter could easily be composted at home, at a benefit to your garden and the environment.</p>

    </a>

    <p class = "main">Also, compost doesn’t just have to be food waste. You can compost hair, fur, ashes, cotton and wool, paper, and tea bags, among many other things (view the full list <a href = "https://www.epa.gov/recycle/composting-home">here</a><link>). The amount of waste that could potentially be reduced if everyone started composting is limitless.</p>

    <p class="main">If your city provides an organics bin, most of the work is done for you. All you need to do is throw out your compostable items into the green bin, and the city will take care of the rest! However one thing to note is that if you are using a bag to collect compost items, make sure it is labeled “compostable” so it can biodegrade properly.</p>

    <p class="main">The last point to be made here is the issue of excessive food waste in America. <a href = "https://research.uga.edu/news/americans-buy-food-knowing-some-will-be-wasted-uga-study-shows/#:~:text=Americans%20buy%20food%20knowing%20some%20will%20be%20wasted%2C%20UGA%20study%20shows,-By%20Sharon%20Dowdy&text=Foods%20that%20top%20the%20%E2%80%9Cmost,throw%20some%20of%20it%20away.">The University of Georiga</a><link> shows that Americans buy excess amounts of food, even if they know some of it will go to waste. The study cites that about one-third of food in the United States goes unconsumed. While composting food does limit the amount of food in landfills, the simple solution, which would benefit the environment even more, is to avoid buying excess amounts of food while grocery shopping and to use foods that expire quickly soon after buying them. There is bound to be food waste in restaurants or grocery stores, but households are part of an easily fixable problem.</p>

    <p class="main">Global warming may seem like an ominous issue to tackle, luckily, that's not your job! Little things make a difference, as a high schooler, even with voting out of the picture you can support laws on a local level to help make your community more sustainable. But at the end of the day it is up to corporations and federal lawmakers to solve this issue once and for all.</p>
